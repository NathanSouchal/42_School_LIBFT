# Libft

Libft is a **custom implementation of the standard C library**, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It serves as a foundational project to reinforce your understanding of memory handling, pointer manipulation, and C fundamentals.

---

## Project Goal

The goal is to **recreate standard C library functions** (like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.) from scratch, and to extend them with additional utilities such as linked list management.

This project is all about:
- Deepening your understanding of low-level programming
- Writing clean, reusable, and well-structured code in pure C
- Preparing you for more complex projects at 42 (like get_next_line, ft_printf, etc.)

## Key Concepts

- Pointers & Memory Allocation
- String Manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Data Structures
- Function Reimplementation
- Header files and Modular Design
